# FraCaS-AMR
A (very beta) annotation of the FraCaS test suite with AMR graphs.  

The original test suite is great, view:
- Using the Framework FraCas: ftp://ftp.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/pub/FRACAS/del16.ps.gz
- The valiant work of Bill McCartney converting that to XML: http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/~wcmac/downloads/fracas.xml

This is less of a precise collection of AMRs and more of a set designed for tinkering with -- all errors are mine.  Some annotations also contain components that will be utilized in AMR phase 3, as with the expanded comparitive semantics.
